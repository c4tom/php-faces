    <p><span class="glossary">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</span> is a classic design 
      pattern often used by applications that need the ability to maintain multiple views 
      of the same data. The MVC pattern hinges on a clean separation of objects into one of
      three categories &#8212; <span class="glossary">models</span> for maintaining data, <span class="glossary">views</span> for displaying all or a portion of the data, and <span class="glossary">controllers</span> for handling events that affect the model 
      or view(s).</p>
    <p>Because of this separation, multiple views and controllers can interface 
      with the same model. Even new types of views and controllers that never existed 
      before can interface with a model without forcing a change in the model design.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="paraLeader">How It Works</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>The MVC abstraction can be graphically represented as follows.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="center"><img src="mvc_dosyalar/mvc.gif" alt="mvc" width="370" height="248" border="0" /></div>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Events typically cause a controller to change a model, or view, or both. Whenever 
      a controller changes a model&#8217;s data or properties, all dependent views are 
      automatically updated. Similarly, whenever a controller changes a view, for example, 
      by revealing areas that were previously hidden, the view gets data from the
      underlying model to refresh itself.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="paraLeader">A Concrete Example</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>We explain the MVC pattern with the help of a simple <span class="glossary">spinner</span> component which consists of a text 
      field and two arrow buttons that can be used to increment or decrement a numeric 
      value shown in the text field. We currently do not have an 
      element type that can directly represent a spinner component, but it easy is to <a href="http://www.enode.com/x/markup/tutorial/spinner.html" name="spinner" id="spinner">synthesize a spinner</a> using existing element
      types.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="center"><img src="mvc_dosyalar/spinnerMVC.gif" alt="mvc" width="222" height="115" border="0" /></div>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>The spinner&#8217;s data is held in a <span class="glossary">model</span> that is <em>shared</em> with the text field. The text field provides a <span class="glossary">view</span> of the spinner&#8217;s current value. Each button 
      in the spinner is an <span class="glossary">event source</span>, that spawns an <span class="glossary">action event</span> every time it is clicked.
      The buttons can be hooked up to <a href="http://www.enode.com/x/markup/tutorial/action.html#trampoline">trampolines</a> that receive action events, and route them to an <span class="glossary">action listener</span> that eventually handles that event. Recall that
      a trampoline is a predefined action listener that simply delegates action handling to
      another listener.</p>
    <p>Depending on the source of the event, the ultimate action listener either 
      increments or decrements the value held in the model &#8212; The action listener is 
      an example of a <span class="glossary">controller</span>.</p>
    <p>The trampolines that initially receive the action events fired by the arrow 
      buttons, are also controllers &#8212; However, instead of modifying the 
      spinner&#8217;s model directly, they delegate the task to a separate controller 
      (action listener).</p>
  </div>
  <p class="paraLeader">Multiple Controllers</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>The MVC pattern allows any number of controllers to modify the same 
      model. While we have so far focused only on the two arrow buttons as likely source of 
      events, there is, in fact, a third event source in this example &#8212; Whenever the
      text field has focus, hitting the <span class="glossary">enter</span> key fires off
      an action event that may potentially be handled by a different action listener than 
      the one handling action events from the buttons.</p>
