View

A view is simply a web page, or a page fragment, like a header, footer, sidebar, etc. In fact, views can flexibly be embedded within other views (within other views, etc., etc.) if you need this type of hierarchy.

view files are interpreted by the runtime facesrenderer

<faces> And </ faces> tag is interpreted between the codes
